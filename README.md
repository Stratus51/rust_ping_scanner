Abandonned because I finally discovered:
- https://www.opte.org/faq/ -> Video of a 3D view of the internet routing
- http://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/ -> Huge DB of routing information since 1997!

The goal of this project was to allow me to view an image of an approximation of the
routing graph of the internet.

Even though Opte's result does not seem to be interactive, it does show a view which
partially satisfies my curiosity. Plus it shows how complex it would be to represent
the network in a clean way due to the dense interconnections.

So right now, I don't plan on trying to create a view of the internet routing anymore.
And even if I did, I would use the RouteView data instead of trying to scrap an
incomplete view of the internet routing by myself.
